Montague (named in honor of mathematician and philosopher [Richard Montague](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Montague) is a library for non-deterministically parsing natural language expressions into a structured form, so that they can be analyzed, or so that inferences may be made from them.

In order to support the largest amount of use cases, montague does not perscribe any specific format for it's output, but some example output types might include prolog, datalog, or some other logic programming language clauses.
